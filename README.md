# From-Shadows-to-Light-Illuminating-Costa-Rican-Household-Poverty-Prediction
+
This repository contains code for predicting household poverty in Costa Rica. The goal is to develop machine learning models that can accurately classify households into different poverty levels.

## Introduction

In this project, we use machine learning techniques to predict household poverty in Costa Rica. The code implements three different models: XGBoost, CatBoost, and LightGBM. These models are optimized using Bayesian Optimization to find the best hyperparameters. The optimized models are then trained on the dataset and evaluated based on their accuracy.

## Installation

To run the code, please ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.7 or above
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- xgboost
- lightgbm
- catboost
- bayesian-optimization
